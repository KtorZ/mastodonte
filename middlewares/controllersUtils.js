  As a reminder, an event can be defined by a day, a month and an hour. The year depends
  of the current year. So, it is possible to plan event only one year before (and it's well enough).
  For instance, let today be the 25 January 2015.
  User enter 14 as day, march as month, and 2:00PM. So, this middleware will delete those tree 
  arguments and replace them by a date > 14 march 2015 14:00. If the user enter 12 January 00:00, 
  the date should be 12 january 2016 00:00. 
  It is important that the input should be name day_[some_suffix], month_[some_suffix], hour_[some_suffix].
  The date will be add to req.body as some_suffix.
